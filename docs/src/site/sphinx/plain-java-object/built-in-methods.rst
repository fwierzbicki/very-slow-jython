Built-in Methods
################

We have outlined how the fixed set of special methods that are "slots"
may be implemented for types defined in Java.
We now move on to named methods of types defined in Java.
These constitute an essentially unbounded set,
given the possibility of defining extension types.

    Code fragments in this section continue in
    ``rt3/src/main/java/.../vsj3/evo1``
    and corresponding test and other directories
    in the project source.
