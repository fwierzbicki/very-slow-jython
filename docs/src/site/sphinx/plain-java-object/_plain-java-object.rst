A Plain Java Object Interpreter
###############################

In this chapter we start afresh on a third model run-time system
in sub-project ``rt3``.

We will test a series of ideas that may make it possible
to treat any Java object as a Python object.
Jython 2 achieves this by wrapping objects
that are not instances of some sub-class of ``PyObject`` in a proxy.
We will attempt to do this so that the interpreter (or compiled code)
handles the object directly.

Concepts developed in sub-project ``rt2`` will be heavily re-used.
