Architecture
############

Previous chapters describe actual implementation experiments.
This chapter is for stepping back from the realised code,
and collecting together two broad kinds of idea
about the architecture of a Java implementation of Python
(assumed to be a Jython 3 candidate):

*   Ideas tested by the implementation experiments and shown to be useful.

*   Speculations not yet tested in the experiments.
    These may become tested ideas in due course,
    quite likely after some adjustment.

There will also be some issues we don't know how to address (yet).
Hopefully, these give rise to speculations
and then tested ideas that address them.
