Compiled Code (Python to JVM)  
#############################

This section is for discussion of
the sort of JVM code that the Python compiler should output.
(If it proves possible to keep them apart,
it will be about the output rather than the compiler.)

..  note:: At the time of writing,
    we have the precedent set by Jython 2,
    but we are fairly sure that the availability in Java
    of features for dynamic language implementation,
    will radically alter this output.
    Changes in the Python language since Python 2,
    will also require new constructs.
