Function Definition and Call
############################

Calling a Function
******************

The "Simple" Call
=================


Our first target is to work out how to call a simple function.
As a motivating example,
suppose we wish to call a built-in function like ``n = len(x)``.
In byte code:

..  code-block:: none

    1           0 LOAD_NAME                0 (len)
                2 LOAD_NAME                1 (x)
                4 CALL_FUNCTION            1
                6 STORE_NAME               2 (n)

Most obviously,
we must implement a new opcode ``CALL_FUNCTION``
and this is probably backed by an abstract API method.

In fact,
there are several opcodes the compiler can generate to make a function call,
depending on the pattern of arguments at the call site.
These are somewhat tuned to C and the CPython byte code.
We'll mostly cut through them and get to our own Java ones in time.
Although ``CALL_FUNCTION`` has the simplest expression in byte code,
it does not have the simplest implementation.


The "Classic" Call
==================

Once upon a time,
all calls compiled to the equivalent of ``f(*args, **kwargs)``,
and this was served by the abstract API ``PyObject_Call``
(see "Python internals: how callables work" `Bendersky 2012-03-23`_).
It's still there to cover this most general case.

We'll return to the optimised forms,
but for now,
we will force the compiler back to a "classic" call with ``n = len(*(x,))``.
In byte code:

..  code-block:: none

      1           0 LOAD_NAME                0 (len)
                  2 LOAD_NAME                1 (x)
                  4 BUILD_TUPLE              1
                  6 CALL_FUNCTION_EX         0
                  8 STORE_NAME               2 (n)

Functions are objects,
so we must define a type to represent functions,
and this type must define a ``tp_call`` slot in its type object,
while an instance of that type must designate an executable function.

In fact there must be several types of function object,
since we need to call (at least)
functions defined in Python
and functions defined in Java.
A function must be a ``PyObject`` so we can bind it to a name in a namespace.

More generally,
we can recognise that ``len`` could have been any callable object,
including an instance of a user-defined class with a ``__call__`` method,
and since the compiler cannot know anything about the actual target,
the same opcode has to work for all of them.

The implementation of the ``CALL_FUNCTION_EX``
(within ``CPythonFrame.eval``)
is straightforward:

..  code-block:: java

                    case Opcode.CALL_FUNCTION_EX:
                        kwargs = oparg == 0 ? null : valuestack[--sp];
                        args = valuestack[--sp]; // POP
                        func = valuestack[sp - 1]; // TOP
                        res = Callables.call(func, args, kwargs);
                        valuestack[sp - 1] = res; // SET_TOP
                        break;

We differ from CPython in dispatching promptly to the abstract interface
``Callables.call``,
where CPython deals with the variety of possible arguments.
As the signature of ``Callables.call(PyObject, PyObject)``
accepts all-comers.
Uses of the equivalent CPython ``PyObject_Call``
have to be guarded with argument checks and conversions
that could usefully be inside the API method.

..  code-block:: java

    class Callables extends Abstract {
        // ...
        static PyObject call(PyObject callable, PyObject args,
                PyObject kwargs) throws TypeError, Throwable {

            // Represent kwargs as a dict (if not already or null)
            PyDictionary kw;
            if (kwargs == null || kwargs instanceof PyDictionary)
                kw = (PyDictionary) kwargs;
            else // ...

            // Represent args as a PyTuple (if not already)
            PyTuple ar;
            if (args instanceof PyTuple)
                ar = (PyTuple) args;
            else  // ...

            try {
                MethodHandle call = callable.getType().tp_call;
                return (PyObject) call.invokeExact(callable, ar, kw);
            } catch (Slot.EmptyException e) {
                throw typeError(OBJECT_NOT_CALLABLE, callable);
            }
        }

As we can see,
the implementation just supplies the checked arguments directly to the slot,
which may be empty if the object is not callable.

Another slight difference from CPython,
is that we make the signature of our ``tp_slot`` strict about type:

..  code-block:: java

    enum Slot {
        // ...
        tp_call(Signature.CALL), //
        // ...

        enum Signature implements ClassShorthand {
            // ...
            CALL(O, S, TUPLE, DICT), // **

This means that receiving implementations
do not have to check and cast their arguments.

The Simple ("Vector") Call
==========================

The classic call protocol involves copying argument data several times,
when done generally.
The call site builds the ``tuple`` from items on the stack
and the receiving function or a wrapper unpacks it to argument variables,
on the Java (or C) call stack (for functions defined in that language),
or into the local variables of the frame.
When the signature at the call site is fixed (something like ``f(a, b)``),
the cost of generality becomes frustrating.

CPython has acquired many optimisations
and special cases designed to short-cut the classic call in simple cases,
especially when the target is a C function.
CPython 3.8 takes an optimisation previously used internally,
improves on it somewhat,
and makes it a public API described in `PEP-590`_.

This is the "vector call protocol",
by which is meant that arguments are found in an array,
that is in fact a slice of the interpreter stack.
It requires that the target C function be capable of receiving that way
(the object implementing a compiled Python function is),
and it requires a different call sequence to be generated by the compiler,
which it does whenever the argument list is simple enough.
The machinery between the new call opcodes and the target
is able to tell whether the receiving function object
implements the vectorcall protocol,
and will form a tuple if it does not.

Jython 2 has a comparable optimisation in which
a polymorphic ``PyObject._call`` has optimised forms
with any fixed number of arguments up to 4.
These come directly from the JVM stack in compiled code.
We are interested in the vector call
in order to implement it for the Python byte code interpreter.
It has limited attraction for Python compiled to the JVM.

..  _PEP-590: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0590


Defining a Function in Java
***************************

A Specialised Callable
======================

We can make a type that defines a ``tp_call`` slot
specific to ``len()`` like this:

..  code-block:: java

    class PyByteCode5 {

        @SuppressWarnings("unused")
        private static class LenCallable implements PyObject {
            static final PyType TYPE = PyType.fromSpec(
                    new PyType.Spec("00LenCallable", LenCallable.class));
            @Override
            public PyType getType() { return TYPE; }

            static PyObject tp_call(LenCallable self, PyTuple args,
                    PyDictionary kwargs) throws Throwable {
                PyObject v = Sequence.getItem(args, 0);
                return Py.val(Abstract.size(v));
            }
        }

We call it for test purposes like this:

..  code-block:: java

        @Test
        void abstract_call() throws TypeError, Throwable {
            PyObject callable = new LenCallable();
            PyObject args = Py.tuple(Py.str("hello"));
            PyObject kwargs = Py.dict();
            PyObject result = Callables.call(callable, args, kwargs);
            assertEquals(Py.val(5), result);
        }

Overriding ``tp_call`` like this works,
and since an instance is a ``PyObject``,
we could bind one to the name "len" in the dictionary of built-ins
that each frame references.
But we need to make this slicker and more general,
and it ought to check the arguments for us.


A Function in a Module
======================

The ``len()`` function belongs to the ``builtins`` module.
This means that the object that represents it
must be entered in the dictionary of that module as the definition of "len".
We have not needed the Python module type before so we quickly define it:

..  code-block:: java

    /** The Python {@code module} object. */
    class PyModule implements PyObject {

        static final PyType TYPE = new PyType("module", PyModule.class);

        @Override
        public PyType getType() { return TYPE; }

        final String name;
        final PyDictionary dict = new PyDictionary();

        PyModule(String name) { this.name = name; }

        /** Initialise the module instance. */
        void init() {}

        @Override
        public String toString() {
            return String.format("<module '%s'>", name);
        }
    }

We intend each actual module to extend this class and define ``init()``.
Note that each class defining a kind of module may have multiple instances,
since each ``Interpreter`` that imports it will create its own.

We would like to define the built-in module somewhat like this:

..  code-block:: java
    :emphasize-lines: 5-7, 12

    class BuiltinsModule extends JavaModule implements Exposed {

        BuiltinsModule() { super("builtins"); }

        static PyObject len(PyObject v) throws Throwable {
            return Py.val(Abstract.size(v));
        }

        @Override
        void init() {
            // Register each method as an exported object
            register("len");
        }
    }

We are imagining some mechanism ``register``,
currently missing from ``PyModule``,
that will put a Python function object wrapping ``len()``
in the module dictionary.
It would be nice to have some mechanism do this registration
automagically  behind the scenes.


CPython ``PyMethodDef`` and ``PyCFunctionObject``
=================================================

How can we devise the mechanism we need to wrap ``len()``?
As usual, we'll look at CPython for ideas.
Here is the definition from CPython (from ``~/Python/bltinmodule.c``):

..  code-block:: c
    :emphasize-lines: 2, 10-22, 26

    /*[clinic input]
    len as builtin_len

        obj: object
        /

    Return the number of items in a container.
    [clinic start generated code]*/

    static PyObject *
    builtin_len(PyObject *module, PyObject *obj)
    /*[clinic end generated code: output=fa7a270d314dfb6c input=bc55598da9e9c9b5]*/
    {
        Py_ssize_t res;

        res = PyObject_Size(obj);
        if (res < 0) {
            assert(PyErr_Occurred());
            return NULL;
        }
        return PyLong_FromSsize_t(res);
    }
    ...
    static PyMethodDef builtin_methods[] = {
        ...
        BUILTIN_LEN_METHODDEF
        BUILTIN_LOCALS_METHODDEF
        {"max",    (PyCFunction)(void(*)(void))builtin_max,
                METH_VARARGS | METH_KEYWORDS, max_doc},
        {"min",    (PyCFunction)(void(*)(void))builtin_min,
                METH_VARARGS | METH_KEYWORDS, min_doc},
        ...
        BUILTIN_SUM_METHODDEF
        {"vars",   builtin_vars, METH_VARARGS, vars_doc},
        {NULL,              NULL},
    };

We can see that in a CPython module,
functions are described in a `method table`_.
Many of the rows of this table are generated as macro definitions,
when it is encountered in CPython standard library modules.

The code itself is simple.
Ours is shorter than CPython's because our errors throw an exception.
A small difference is that in CPython,
the first argument of a module-level function is the module itself,
as if the module were a class and the function a method of it.
In all the functions of almost every module of CPython,
this module argument is ignored.
Very occasionally, some per-module storage is accessed.
In Java, we would get the same effect by making ``len()`` an instance method,
and the per-module storage would be the instance variables.
However, let's see if we can do without the extra argument.

A large part of the volume in C
is the header that defines the function to `Argument Clinic`_.
This is the gadget that turns a complex comment into code for processing
the arguments and built-in documentation.
In this case, the results are simple.
(There is no intermediate ``builtin_len_impl``.)
The generated code is in ``~/Python/clinic/bltinmodule.c.h``,
and provides a modified version of the special comment as a doc-string,
and the macro that fills one line of the method definition table.

..  code-block:: c
    :emphasize-lines: 7-8

    PyDoc_STRVAR(builtin_len__doc__,
    "len($module, obj, /)\n"
    "--\n"
    "\n"
    "Return the number of items in a container.");

    #define BUILTIN_LEN_METHODDEF    \
        {"len", (PyCFunction)builtin_len, METH_O, builtin_len__doc__},

The important part of this for us at present is the use of ``PyMethodDef``
to describe the function,
and particularly ``METH_O``, which is a setting of the ``ml_flags`` field,
and the pointer to function stored in field ``ml_meth``.
The handling of a call by a ``PyCFunctionObject``,
which represents a function (or method) defined in C,
is steered by this data.

Only a few combinations of flags are valid,
and each corresponds to a supported signature in C.

.. csv-table:: CPython ``PyMethodDef`` signatures
   :header: "Flags", "Type of ``meth``", "Call made"
   :widths: 10, 20, 30

    "``METH_NOARGS``", "``PyCFunction``", "``(*meth) (self, NULL)``"
    "``METH_O``", "``PyCFunction``", "``(*meth) (self, args[0])``"
    "``METH_VARARGS``", "``PyCFunction``", "``(*meth) (self, argtuple)``"
    "``METH_VARARGS | METH_KEYWORDS``", "``PyCFunctionWithKeywords``", "``(*meth) (self, argtuple, kwdict)``"
    "``METH_FASTCALL``", "``_PyCFunctionFast``", "``(*meth) (self, args, nargs)``"
    "``METH_FASTCALL | METH_KEYWORDS``", "``_PyCFunctionFastWithKeywords``", "``(*meth) (self, args, nargs, kwnames)``"

Here ``self`` is the module or target object,
``argtuple`` is a ``tuple`` of positional arguments,
``kwdict`` is a keyword ``dict`` (all these are as in the classic call),
``args`` is an array of positional arguments followed by keyword ones,
``kwnames`` is a tuple of the names of the keyword arguments in that array,
and ``nargs`` is the number of positional arguments.
``args`` may actually be a pointer into the stack,
where we can find the ``nargs + len(kwnames)`` arguments,
placed there by the ``CALL_FUNCTION`` opcode.

Although the table shows the same C type ``PyCFunction``
for three of the flag configurations,
this is not ambiguous.
The flags control how the arguments will be presented,
not the type.
The built-in functions ``locals()`` (takes no arguments),
``len()`` (takes one argument), and
``vars()`` (takes zero arguments or one),
have the same C signatures but their flag settings are
``METH_NOARGS``, ``METH_O`` and ``METH_VARARGS`` respectively.

The allowable types of ``ml_meth``
are defined in the C header ``methodobject.h``,
and ``ml_meth`` may need to be cast to one of them to make the call correct:

..  code-block:: c

    typedef PyObject *(*PyCFunction)(PyObject *, PyObject *);
    typedef PyObject *(*_PyCFunctionFast)
                (PyObject *, PyObject *const *, Py_ssize_t);
    typedef PyObject *(*PyCFunctionWithKeywords)
                (PyObject *, PyObject *, PyObject *);
    typedef PyObject *(*_PyCFunctionFastWithKeywords)
                (PyObject *, PyObject *const *, Py_ssize_t,  PyObject *);
    typedef PyObject *(*PyNoArgsFunction)(PyObject *);

As we have seen,
`Argument Clinic`_ generates the ``PyMethodDef`` for a function,
assigning the flags based on the text signature in its input.
The signature of the implementation function
would not be enough to determine the flags.

.. _Argument Clinic: https://docs.python.org/3/howto/clinic.html


Java ``MethodDef`` and ``PyJavaFunction``
=========================================

..  We try not to put Py as a prefix unless it's a PyObject
    and Object as a suffix seems unnecessary.

We now look for a way to describe functions
that is satisfactory for a Java implementation of Python.
The CPython version is quite complicated
and it has not been easy to distill the essential idea.

The ``builtin_function_or_method`` class (a.k.a. ``PyCFunctionObject``)
is a visible feature,
so we define a corresponding ``PyJavaFunction`` class,
which will represent built-in functions.
The essence of that class is as follows:

..  code-block:: java
    :emphasize-lines: 7-8, 12, 19

    /** The Python {@code builtin_function_or_method} object. */
    class PyJavaFunction implements PyObject {

        static final PyType TYPE = new PyType("builtin_function_or_method",
                PyJavaFunction.class);
        //...
        final MethodDef methodDef;
        final MethodHandle tpCall;

        PyJavaFunction(MethodDef def) {
            this.methodDef = def;
            this.tpCall = getTpCallHandle(def);
        }
        //...

        static PyObject tp_call(PyJavaFunction f, PyTuple args,
                PyDictionary kwargs) throws Throwable {
            try {
                return (PyObject) f.tpCall.invokeExact(args, kwargs);
            } catch (BadCallException bce) {
                f.methodDef.check(args, kwargs);
                // never returns ...
            }
        }
    }

Just like in CPython's ``PyCFunction``,
our ``PyJavaFunction`` is linked to a method definition (``MethodDef``)
that supplies the name, characteristics and documentation string.
The implementation of ``tp_call`` is one line,
passing on the (classic) arguments,
plus a catch that turns a simple lightweight ``BadCallException``,
thrown when the number or kind of arguments is incorrect,
into a proper ``TypeError`` diagnosed by the ``MethodDef``.

Our ``MethodDef`` (greatly simplified) looks like this:

..  code-block:: java
    :emphasize-lines: 3

    class MethodDef {
        final String name;
        final MethodHandle meth;
        final EnumSet<Flag> flags;
        final String doc;

        enum Flag {VARARGS, KEYWORDS, FASTCALL}

        MethodDef(String name, MethodHandle mh, EnumSet<Flag> flags,
                String doc) {
            this.name = name;
            this.meth = mh;
            this.doc = doc;
            this.flags = calcFlags(flags);
        }

        //...

        void check(PyTuple args, PyDictionary kwargs) throws TypeError {
            // Check args, kwargs for the ase defined by flags and
            // throw a properly formatted TypeError
            // ...
        }

        int getNargs() {
            MethodType type = meth.type();
            int n = type.parameterCount();
            return flags.contains(Flag.STATIC) ? n : n - 1;
        }
    }

We do not define the flags ``METH_NOARGS`` and ``METH_O``
used by CPython to represent special cases in the number of arguments,
but we have a ``Nargs()`` function valid when ``VARARGS`` is not present.
``calcFlags`` examines the ``MethodHandle mh``
to decide whether it represents a fixed arity or ``VARARGS`` type,
and whether it has ``KEYWORDS``.

Each of these objects ``MethodDef`` and ``PyJavaFunction``
contains a ``MethodHandle``: what is the difference?

``MethodDef.meth`` is the handle of the method as defined in the module.
Its type conforms to small set of allowable signatures.
The allowable flag configurations and module-level signatures
are an implementation choice for a Java Python:
we do not have to mimic CPython.

``PyJavaFunction.tpCall`` wraps ``PyJavaFunction.methodDef.meth``
to conform to the signature ``(PyTuple,PyDictionary)PyObject``.
This reflects the ``(*args, **kwargs)`` calling pattern that we must support.
This handle is built by ``PyJavaFunction.getTpCallHandle``,
when invoked from the constructor.

Building this is a little complicated,
so we break it down into a helper for each major type of target signature.
Here is the one for a fixed-arity function like ``len()``:

..  code-block:: java

    class PyJavaFunction implements PyObject {
        // ...
        private static class Util {
            // ... Many method handles defined here!
            static MethodHandle wrapFixedArity(MethodDef def) {
                // Number or arguments expected by the def target f
                int n = def.getNargs();
                // f = λ u0, u1, ... u(n-1) : meth(u0, u1, ... u(n-1))
                MethodHandle f = def.meth;
                // fv = λ v k : meth(v[0], v[1], ... v[n-1])
                MethodHandle fv =
                        dropArguments(f.asSpreader(OA, n), 1, DICT);
                // argsOK = λ v k : (k==null || k.empty()) && v.length==n
                MethodHandle argsOK =
                        insertArguments(fixedArityGuard, 2, n);
                // Use the guard to switch between calling and throwing
                // g = λ v k : argsOK(v,k) ? fv(v,k) : throw BadCall
                MethodHandle g = guardWithTest(argsOK, fv, throwBadCallOA);
                // λ a k : g(a.value, k)
                return filterArguments(g, 0, getValue);
            }

            private static boolean fixedArityGuard(PyObject[] a,
                    PyDictionary d, int n) {
                return (d == null || d.size() == 0) && a.length == n;
            }
        }
    }

At the time of writing,
support for FASTCALL is incomplete.
It may be sufficient simply to form a ``tuple`` from the stack slice.
Efficient support for ``CALL_FUNCTION``
is advantageous for CPython byte code but not at all in JVM byte code,
where we cannot address the JVM stack as a memory array.
