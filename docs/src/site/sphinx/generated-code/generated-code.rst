A Generated Code Interpreter
############################

In this chapter we start afresh on a second model run-time system
in sub-project ``rt2``.
We use the knowledge gained writing the code in sub-project ``rt1``
to bank some architectural concepts
(that will hopefully prove enduring)
but take a different approach to implementation.

    introduction
    interpreter-cpython-byte-code
    type-and-arithmetic
    sequences-and-indexing
    built-in-inheritance
    comparison-and-loops
    refactor-to-evo3
    function-definition-and-call
    classes-and-attributes

..  I think the chapters might go like this,
    but I'm not certain enough to create the files:
    mutable-types (object base and a hint of inheritance)
    attribute-access
    exceptions
    class-definition-and-instantiation
    inheritance
    adopted-java-types
    found-java-types
    code-objects-in-java-bytecode
