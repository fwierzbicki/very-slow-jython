A Generated Code Interpreter

In this chapter we start afresh on a second mopdel interpreter
in package ``vsj2``.
We use the knowledge gained writing the code in ``vsj1``
to set out a compelling,
and hopefully effective,
set of architectural concepts for:

* an implementation of the Python object model, and
* interpreting code within a ``frame``.
