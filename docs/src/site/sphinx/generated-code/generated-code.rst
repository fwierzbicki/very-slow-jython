A Generated Code Interpreter
############################

In this chapter we start afresh on a second model run-time system
in sub-project ``rt2``.
We use the knowledge gained writing the code in sub-project ``rt1``
to bank some architectural concepts
(that will hopefully prove enduring)
but take a different approach to implementation.

..  I think the chapters might go like this,
    but I'm not certain enough to create the files:
    basic-type-system
    attribute-access
    mutable-types (object base and a hint of inheritance)
    test-branch-jump
    function-definition-and-call
    exceptions
    class-definition-and-instantiation
    inheritance

    found-java-types
    code-objects-in-java-bytecode
