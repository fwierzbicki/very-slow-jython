A Generated Code Interpreter

In this chapter we start afresh on a second model run-time system
in sub-project ``rt2``.
We use the knowledge gained writing the code in sub-project ``rt1``
to set out a compelling,
and hopefully effective,
set of architectural concepts for:

* an implementation of the Python object model,
* use of Java's dynamic language support features, and 
* interpreting code within a ``frame``.
