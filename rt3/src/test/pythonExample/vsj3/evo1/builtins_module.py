# The focus of this test is the way the interpreter resolves names
# in the builtins dictionary (after local and global namespaces).
# This happens in opcodes LOAD_NAME and LOAD_GLOBAL.

# Access sample objects from the builtins module implicitly
# Opcode is LOAD_NAME

int_name = int.__name__
max_name = max.__name__

# Call functions to prove we can
# Opcode is LOAD_NAME
ai = abs(-42)
af = abs(-41.9)

# Access from within a nested scope

def f(x):
    # Opcode is LOAD_GLOBAL
    return abs(x), min.__name__

aj, min_name = f(-123_000_000_000)

# Sometimes __builtins__ is not the builtins module. Find it with:
bi = max.__self__

# Check explicit attribute access to the (real) builtins module
bi_int_name = bi.int.__name__
bi_max_name = bi.max.__name__


# Not marshallable
del bi, f
